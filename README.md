import pandas as pd
This Jupyter notebook demonstrates a simple machine learning approach to the Titanic survival prediction problem using Python and the scikit-learn library.

**Key Steps:**

1.  **Import Libraries:** Imports necessary libraries like `os`, `kagglehub`, `numpy`, `pandas`, and `RandomForestClassifier` from `sklearn`.
2.  **Kaggle Integration:** Logs in to Kaggle using API keys (ensure these are set as environment variables or handled securely). Downloads the 'titanic' competition dataset using `kagglehub`.
3.  **Data Loading and Exploration:**
    *   Loads the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files into pandas DataFrames.
    *   Displays the first few rows of each DataFrame (`.head()`).
    *   Calculates and prints the survival rates for women and men in the training data to provide a basic understanding of the data's patterns.
4.  **Feature Engineering and Model Training:**
    *   Defines the target variable `y` (Survived) and the features `features` (Pclass, Sex, SibSp, Parch) to be used for prediction.
    *   Uses `pd.get_dummies()` to convert the categorical 'Sex' feature into a numerical one-hot encoded format, which is required by the machine learning model.
    *   Initializes a `RandomForestClassifier` model with specific parameters (`n_estimators=100`, `max_depth=5`, `random_state=1`).
    *   Trains the model using the `fit()` method on the prepared training data (`X` and `y`).
5.  **Prediction and Submission:**
    *   Makes predictions on the prepared test data (`X_test`) using the trained model's `predict()` method.
    *   Creates a pandas DataFrame `output` with 'PassengerId' from the test data and the generated 'Survived' predictions.
    *   Saves this output DataFrame to a CSV file named `submission.csv` in the current directory, in the format required for submission to the Kaggle competition.

**Purpose:**

This notebook provides a basic working example of how to load data, perform minimal data preprocessing (one-hot encoding), train a simple classification model (Random Forest), and generate a submission file for the Titanic competition on Kaggle. It serves as a starting point and can be extended with more advanced feature engineering, model tuning, and evaluation techniques.
